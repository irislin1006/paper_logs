- **Simplified environments**: AI tasks are **cleanly defined**, unlike real R&D, which involves **coordination and unclear objectives**.
- **No parallel projects**: Real AI R&D requires handling **multiple tasks simultaneously**, which AI cannot yet do effectively.

### **Why AI’s Performance Might Be Underestimated**
- AI is **cheaper**: AI costs **~$123 per run**, compared to **$1,855 per human expert**.
- AI **may need new workflows**: AI models might need **different tools** than humans to excel in AI R&D.

---

## **6. Conclusion**
- AI **currently cannot fully automate AI R&D** but is **competitive in certain tasks**.
- AI agents show **rapid improvements**, suggesting that **automation risks should be monitored**.
- Future benchmarks should test AI in **longer time frames, more ambiguous tasks, and multi-task settings**.

### **TL;DR**
1. **AI beats humans in short (2-hour) ML research tasks but loses over longer periods (8+ hours).**
2. **AI is faster but lacks the strategic thinking and debugging skills of human experts.**
3. **AI excels in structured optimization tasks but struggles with open-ended problem-solving.**
4. **Humans improve more with time, while AI plateaus.**
5. **AI is much cheaper than human labor, meaning improvements could come via scaling.**
6. **AI R&D is far more complex than RE-Bench’s scope, so AI’s real-world performance may be worse.**
